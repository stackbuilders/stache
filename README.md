This is a Haskell implementation of Mustache templates. The implementation
conforms to the version 1.1.3 of the official [Mustache
specification](https://github.com/mustache/spec). It has a minimal but
complete APIâ€”three functions to compile templates (from directory, from
file, and from lazy text) and one to render them.

The implementation uses the Megaparsec parsing library to parse the
templates which results in high-quality error messages.

For rendering one only needs to create Aeson's `Value` that is used for
interpolation of template variables. Since the library re-uses Aeson's
instances and most data types in the Haskell ecosystem are instances of
classes like `Data.Aeson.ToJSON`, the process is simple for the end user.

Template Haskell helpers for compilation of templates at compile time are
available in the `Text.Mustache.Compile.TH` module.

One feature that is not currently supported is lambdas. The feature is
marked as optional in the spec and can be emulated via processing of parsed
template representation. The decision to drop lambdas is intentional, for
the sake of simplicity and better integration with Aeson.

## Usage

Here is an example of basic usage:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

module Main (main) where

import Data.Aeson
import Data.Text
import Text.Megaparsec
import Text.Mustache
import qualified Data.Text.Lazy.IO as TIO

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let res = compileMustacheText "foo"
        "Hi, {{name}}! You have:\n{{#things}}\n  * {{.}}\n{{/things}}\n"
  case res of
    Left bundle -> putStrLn (errorBundlePretty bundle)
    Right template -> TIO.putStr $ renderMustache template $ object
      [ "name"   .= ("John" :: Text)
      , "things" .= ["pen" :: Text, "candle", "egg"]
      ]
```

If I run the program, it prints the following:

```
Hi, John! You have:
  * pen
  * candle
  * egg
```
